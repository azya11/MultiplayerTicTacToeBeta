# MultiplayerTicTacToe
Ideas:
- Add a DM for each player
- Add a leaderboard
- Add a lobby
- Add a way to play with friends
- Add a way to play with random people
- Add a way to play with bots
- Mobile responsiveness
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Drag/drop or animation effects

Bugs:
- When a player leaves the game, the game should end and the other player should be notified
- When a player logs out, the friend list should be updated
